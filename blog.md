## About Me
My name is Shehzad Yameen. I'm a rising junior in Hunter College, and am a computer science major. I enjoy coding and working with computers. My dad did a lot of computer science when he was younger and has a shelf full of books relating to computers and the like. Thus, I've always been exposed to electronics when I was younger. I've always loved sci-fi movies that delved into the advanced technologies of their age, and have an appreciation for the aesthetic that functional code has. I joined this bootcamp so that I can learn and hopefully gain some knowledge about what I'll enjoy doing in the future when I graduate with a degree. Thanks for reading.
